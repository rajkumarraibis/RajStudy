### **1. General AI & GenAI Questions**
#### **Q1: What is Generative AI, and how does it differ from traditional AI?**
**A:**  
Generative AI refers to models that can generate new content, such as text, images, and music, rather than just making predictions or classifications. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily focuses on recognizing patterns and making decisions based on existing data, GenAI models (e.g., GPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) create new content by learning from large-scale training datasets.

#### **Q2: How do you ensure the reliability and scalability of GenAI models in production?**  
**A:**  
- Use **MLOps** practices for continuous monitoring, retraining, and deployment.  
- Optimize models using **quantization** and **distillation** to reduce computational costs.  
- Implement **caching mechanisms** for frequently used prompts to improve efficiency.  
- Deploy on **cloud-native environments** (Kubernetes, serverless) for auto-scaling.  
- Monitor **bias and drift detection** using fairness-aware metrics.

#### **Q3: What are the challenges of deploying GenAI models in a cloud-native environment?**  
**A:**  
- **Resource-intensive computations** requiring high-performance GPUs/TPUs.  
- **Latency issues** in real-time inference.  
- **Data security and privacy concerns** (e.g., confidential customer data).  
- **Compliance with AI ethics** (e.g., fairness, explainability).  
- **Handling unstructured inputs effectively** (e.g., text, images).

### **2. Cloud & AI Architecture Questions**
#### **Q4: How would you design a scalable AI architecture for a global enterprise?**  
**A:**  
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Use Kafka, AWS Kinesis, or GCP Pub/Sub for real-time streaming.  
2. **Storage Layer**: Use data lakes (AWS S3, GCP BigQuery) with structured/unstructured data.  
3. **Model Training Layer**: Use ML pipelines with Databricks, Vertex AI, or SageMaker.  
4. **Model Serving Layer**: Deploy via Kubernetes + Istio (for load balancing and service mesh).  
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Use Prometheus + Grafana for real-time monitoring.  

#### **Q5: What factors do you consider when choosing between on-premise, hybrid, and cloud-native AI deployments?**  
**A:**  
- **Latency**: On-premise for ultra-low latency, cloud for standard.  
- **Scalability**: Cloud is better for dynamic workloads.  
- **Compliance & Security**: On-prem for regulated industries (finance, healthcare).  
- **Cost**: Cloud-native is cost-effective for startups; hybrid is good for large enterprises with legacy systems.  

#### **Q6: Explain 12-factor app methodology and its relevance to AI architectures.**  
**A:**  
The **12-factor app methodology** is a set of principles for building scalable, cloud-native applications. In AI, it ensures:  
- **Codebase versioning** (Git for ML models).  
- **Dependency isolation** (Docker, virtual environments).  
- **Config management** (env variables for AI model tuning).  
- **Stateless & scalable services** (microservices, Kubernetes).

### **3. MLOps & Model Lifecycle Management**
#### **Q7: How do you manage ML model lifecycle in production?**  
**A:**  
- **Versioning**: Track model versions via MLflow, DVC.  
- **Automated deployment**: CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).  
- **Drift monitoring**: Use tools like Alibi Detect for concept drift detection.  
- **Feedback loop**: Retrain models periodically with updated data.  

#### **Q8: What tools would you use to build an end-to-end MLOps pipeline?**  
**A:**  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Apache Airflow, AWS Glue.  
- **Model Training**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebooks.  
- **Model Deployment**: Kubernetes + Istio, AWS SageMaker.  
- **Monitoring & Explainability**: MLflow, Prometheus.

- **Cache embeddings**: Precompute responses for frequent queries.  
- **Distributed training**: Use Horovod, TPUs, or multi-GPU setups.  

#### **Q10: How do you handle real-time AI model inferencing at scale?**  
**A:**  
- **Load balancing**: Kubernetes + Istio for scaling inference pods.  
- **Edge AI**: Run models closer to the data source to reduce latency.  
- **Asynchronous inference**: Use Kafka, Redis queues for batch processing.

- Regularly audit model outputs for **disparate impact**.  

#### **Q12: How do you secure AI models in production?**  
**A:**  
- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).  
- **Use access controls** (IAM roles, OAuth 2.0) for API access.  
- **Monitor adversarial attacks** using anomaly detection models.
