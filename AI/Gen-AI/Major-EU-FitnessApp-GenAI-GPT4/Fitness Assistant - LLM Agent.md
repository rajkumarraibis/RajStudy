## 🔹 RAG vs. AI Agents: Key Differences

| Feature                | RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  | AI Agents (Multi-Agent System)  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Core Functionality**  | Fetches & augments information  | Takes **actions & decisions** autonomously |
| **Data Source**  | Vector Databases (Pinecone, ChromaDB)  | APIs, User Feedback, Memory Storage |
| **Decision Making** | LLM only retrieves **relevant info** | AI Agent **analyzes & executes** decisions |
| **Use Case**  | **FAQ, Chatbots, Research Assistants** | **Personal Assistants, AI Coaching, Task Automation** |
