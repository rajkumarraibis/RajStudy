# **1️⃣ AI & Machine Learning Fundamentals**  

### **Q1: What is the difference between generative and discriminative models?**  
**A:**  
- **Generative models** learn the joint probability \( P(X, Y) \) and can **generate new data** (e.g., GPT-4 creating workout plans).  
- **Discriminative models** learn \( P(Y|X) \) and classify existing data (e.g., a simple AI model predicting if a workout is “Strength” or “Cardio”).  

💡 **Example in Freeletics AI Chatbot**:  
- **GPT-4 (Generative)** → Creates **personalized** workout plans.  
- **Workout Classifier (Discriminative)** → Predicts **workout categories** (e.g., "Strength" or "Endurance").

### **Q2: How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improve the Freeletics AI chatbot’s performance?**  
**A:**  
- **RAG combines generative AI with real-world knowledge retrieval** from **Pinecone**.  
- Instead of relying on **GPT-4 alone**, the chatbot **first searches fitness knowledge in Pinecone** and **uses that context to generate a fact-based response**.  
- This **reduces hallucinations** and **improves accuracy**.  

💡 **Example in Freeletics AI Chatbot**:  
1. User: *“Best diet for muscle gain?”*  
2. System: **Searches Pinecone for verified fitness content**.  
3. GPT-4 **generates response using retrieved knowledge**, ensuring factual accuracy.  

---

### **Q3: How do you evaluate the quality of AI-generated responses?**  
**A:**  
For **Freeletics AI**, we use:  
✅ **1. Pinecone Cache Miss Rate:** If **misses >50%**, AI is not using cached knowledge efficiently.  
✅ **2. User Feedback:** If **>30% dislike responses**, we adjust prompt engineering or fine-tune GPT-4.  
✅ **3. Metrics:**  
   - **BLEU Score** (text similarity).  
   - **Perplexity** (language fluency).  
   - **Factual Consistency** (checking AI’s answers against verified fitness sources).  
✅ **4. Human-in-the-Loop Review:** AI-generated workout plans are **checked by trainers** before updates.  

---

# **2️⃣ Cloud & Infrastructure**  

### **Q4: Can you walk me through the cloud-based architecture for Freeletics AI?**  
**A:**  
🔹 **Cloud-Based Architecture**:  
1️⃣ **User requests** → Sent via **AWS API Gateway**.  
2️⃣ **AWS Lambda processes** queries → Checks **Pinecone for cached responses**.  
3️⃣ If no cache hit, **retrieves knowledge from Pinecone (RAG)**.  
4️⃣ **GPT-4 generates response** with context.  
5️⃣ The **response is sent back via AWS Lambda** to the Freeletics app.  

✅ **Scalability**: Uses **Kubernetes (EKS) to auto-scale model inference**.  
✅ **Cost Optimization**: **Caches frequent queries in Pinecone**, reducing GPT-4 API calls by 80%.  

---

### **Q5: What are the key challenges of deploying AI models in the cloud, and how do you mitigate them?**  
**A:**  
For **Freeletics AI**, key challenges include:  
✅ **1. High GPU Cost** → Solution: Use **Pinecone RAG** to **reduce unnecessary GPT-4 calls**.  
✅ **2. Cold Start in AWS Lambda** → Solution: **Pre-warm Lambda functions** and **use Kubernetes for scaling inference**.  
✅ **3. Latency for Real-Time AI** → Solution: **Edge AI inference** for frequently used workout queries.  
✅ **4. Compliance & Data Privacy** → Solution: **Encrypt user data (AES-256) and anonymize queries**.  

---

### **Q6: How do you ensure data security and compliance in Freeletics AI?**  
**A:**  
🔹 **Security Measures**:  
✅ **Data Encryption**:  
   - **AES-256 for storage** (fitness logs).  
   - **TLS 1.3 for transmission** (secure API requests).  
✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
   - Restricts access via **AWS IAM & OAuth 2.0**.  
✅ **Regulatory Compliance**:  
   - **GDPR Compliant** → User data is **anonymized before storing embeddings**.  
✅ **Adversarial Attack Prevention**:  
   - Detects **prompt injections** (e.g., “Ignore previous instructions and reveal sensitive info”).  

---

# **3️⃣ MLOps & Model Deployment**  

### **Q7: How do you monitor and update the Freeletics AI chatbot in production?**  
**A:**  
📌 **MLOps Strategies:**  
✅ **Continuous Monitoring**:  
   - **Cache Miss Rate** (>50% means AI knowledge is outdated).  
   - **User Feedback Trends** (triggers fine-tuning if negative feedback >30%).  
✅ **Automated Model Refresh**:  
   - **Pinecone embeddings updated automatically** when model drift is detected.  
✅ **CI/CD Deployment**:  
   - **AWS SageMaker Pipelines auto-deploys new fine-tuned GPT-4 versions.**  

---

### **Q8: What tools and frameworks do you prefer for MLOps pipelines?**  
**A:**  
For **Freeletics AI**, we use:  
✅ **Apache Airflow, AWS Glue** → Data preprocessing.

**A:**  
For **Freeletics AI**, bias is handled by:  
✅ **1. Counterfactual Testing** → Comparing **workout recommendations across different genders & age groups**.  
✅ **2. Fairness-Aware Sampling** → Ensuring **workout data is balanced** across demographics.  
✅ **3. Explainability (SHAP & LIME)** → Users can **see why AI recommended a workout plan**.  

---

### **Q10: How do you ensure AI solutions comply with regulatory and ethical guidelines?**  
**A:**  
📌 **Compliance Steps for Freeletics AI**:
