## üß© **AWS Glue vs. EMR Serverless ‚Äî Detailed Comparison**

| **Category**                       | **AWS Glue (ETL / Spark)**                                                                                             | **Amazon EMR Serverless**                                                                                | **Remarks**                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compute Model**                  | Uses **Data Processing Units (DPUs)** ‚Äî each DPU = 4 vCPU + 16 GB memory.                                              | Uses **vCPU-seconds**, **memory-seconds**, and **storage-seconds** with flexible allocation.             | Glue‚Äôs DPU model is opaque; you can‚Äôt control executor count or driver specs directly.    |
| **Capacity Scaling**               | Auto-scaling within Glue-managed limits (up to **1,000 DPUs per job**, but typically limited by account).              | Fully elastic scaling based on Spark executor demand; can go from 0 to hundreds of executors.            | Glue scaling granularity is coarse ‚Äî DPUs scale in large blocks; EMR scales per executor. |
| **Memory & Executor Control**      | ‚ùå No direct control ‚Äî only job parameters like `--DPU` count and `--job-language`.                                     | ‚úÖ Fine-grained Spark configuration possible (e.g., `spark.executor.memory`, `spark.executor.instances`). | Glue hides Spark internals; EMR gives full Spark control.                                 |
| **Parallelism / Concurrency**      | Limited concurrency per account (default 3 jobs per region, can request increase). Each job limited to DPU allocation. | High concurrency ‚Äî each EMR Serverless application can run multiple jobs simultaneously.                 | Glue is more restrictive for parallel processing pipelines.                               |
| **Startup Time (Job Cold Start)**  | 1‚Äì3 minutes typical startup latency before job runs.                                                                   | 30‚Äì60 seconds or less (can pre-warm capacity).                                                           | Glue has slower cold start due to environment provisioning.                               |
| **Framework Support**              | Spark (PySpark, Scala), Python Shell, Glue for Ray (limited).                                                          | Spark, Hive (and roadmap for Presto/Trino).                                                              | EMR supports broader engines and evolving runtime ecosystem.                              |
| **Spark Version Control**          | Fixed per Glue version (e.g., Glue 4.0 = Spark 3.3.0).                                                                 | You can choose EMR runtime (e.g., EMR 6.15 ‚Üí Spark 3.5).                                                 | EMR lets you migrate or test different Spark versions easily.                             |
| **Custom JARs / Libraries**        | Limited ‚Äî must upload `.whl`, `.egg`, or `.zip` to S3. No internet access during job.                                  | Flexible ‚Äî you can use bootstrap scripts or custom runtime environments with full package access.        | Glue dependency management is painful for complex libraries.                              |
| **Python Support**                 | Only specific Python versions supported per Glue version (e.g., 3.10 for Glue 4.0).                                    | Supports multiple Python versions depending on EMR runtime.                                              | Glue limits Python upgrades until new Glue version release.                               |
| **Resource Monitoring**            | CloudWatch logs only; limited Spark UI access (short-lived).                                                           | Full Spark UI, History Server, and detailed CloudWatch metrics.                                          | Glue‚Äôs Spark UI disappears post-job; EMR provides persistent visibility.                  |
| **Network Access**                 | No internet access by default (unless VPC-enabled).                                                                    | Can access internet or internal VPC endpoints easily.                                                    | Glue jobs often fail if they require fetching external Python libs.                       |
| **Data Catalog Integration**       | Tight integration with AWS Glue Data Catalog (default metadata store).                                                 | Can use Glue Catalog, Hive Metastore, or custom Iceberg/Hudi/Delta catalogs.                             | Glue wins on built-in catalog, EMR wins on flexibility.                                   |
| **File Format Support**            | Parquet, ORC, JSON, CSV, Avro, XML (limited).                                                                          | All major formats + Delta, Iceberg, Hudi, etc.                                                           | EMR has richer data lake format support.                                                  |
| **Auto-scaling Transparency**      | Limited visibility ‚Äî Glue decides DPU scaling internally.                                                              | Transparent executor-based scaling, visible in Spark UI.                                                 | Glue scaling often feels ‚Äúblack box.‚Äù                                                     |
| **Runtime Customization**          | Minimal ‚Äî cannot install system-level dependencies or modify JVM settings.                                             | Full control ‚Äî Spark configs, environment variables, bootstrap actions.                                  | EMR Serverless behaves closer to self-managed Spark cluster.                              |
| **Job Types**                      | ETL jobs, Python shell, streaming (with Glue Streaming).                                                               | Batch Spark jobs, streaming, interactive Hive queries.                                                   | Glue Streaming limited in throughput and checkpointing.                                   |
| **Streaming Support**              | Yes, via **Glue Streaming**, but limited throughput and restricted connector set.                                      | Yes, via **Spark Structured Streaming** or **Flink** on EMR (future).                                    | EMR better for real-time or continuous streaming.                                         |
| **Integration with Orchestration** | Glue Workflows, Step Functions, EventBridge.                                                                           | Airflow, Step Functions, custom schedulers.                                                              | EMR integrates more easily with Airflow.                                                  |
| **Pricing Model**                  | Per **DPU-hour** (rounded to nearest second, min. 1 minute).                                                           | Per **vCPU-second, GB-second, and storage-second**.                                                      | EMR pricing is more granular and transparent.                                             |
| **Cost Visibility**                | Limited ‚Äî billed per DPU-hour; can‚Äôt see executor-level costs.                                                         | Detailed job-level metrics; easy cost attribution per job.                                               | EMR gives better insight into per-stage resource usage.                                   |
| **Performance Tuning**             | Limited ‚Äî can use job bookmarks, partition pushdown, etc.                                                              | Extensive ‚Äî can adjust shuffle partitions, dynamic allocation, caching, etc.                             | EMR gives full Spark tuning capability.                                                   |
| **IAM / Security**                 | Managed roles and policies; Glue service role mandatory.                                                               | Same AWS IAM integration, but more control over VPC and KMS setup.                                       | Glue easier but less flexible for complex enterprise setups.                              |
| **Use Case Fit**                   | Simple ETL, schema discovery, integration with Glue Catalog and Redshift.                                              | Complex Spark/Hive workloads, ML feature pipelines, interactive analytics.                               | Glue = low-code ETL; EMR = advanced data engineering.                                     |
