  - Elastic Load Balancer (ALB, NLB, CLB)
  - Security Groups and Network ACLs
  - Direct Connect and VPNs

- **Database**:
  - RDS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Aurora)
  - DynamoDB (NoSQL, global tables, TTL, indexing)
  - Redshift (Data Warehousing)

---

### **2. Data Engineering and Analytics**
- **Big Data Services**:
  - EMR (Elastic MapReduce)
  - Glue (ETL, Data Catalog)
  - Athena (querying data in S3 using SQL)
  - Kinesis (Data Streams, Firehose, Analytics)
  - Data Pipeline

- **Data Lake Architecture**:
  - Best practices for building and optimizing data lakes on AWS.
  - Lake Formation (managing permissions and automation).

- **Machine Learning Integration**:
  - SageMaker for ML model development and deployment.
  - Integration of AI/ML with Big Data pipelines.

---

### **3. Security**
- IAM:
  - Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies.
  - Best practices for least privilege access.
  - Identity Federation and SSO.

- Encryption:
  - KMS (Key Management Service).
  - S3 encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, CSE).
  - EBS encryption.

- Monitoring & Compliance:
  - CloudTrail (audit logging).
  - Config (compliance checks).
  - GuardDuty, Macie, Inspector.

---

### **4. Serverless Architecture**
- Lambda best practices:
  - Event-driven architectures.
  - Integration with S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Step Functions.

- API Gateway:
  - REST and WebSocket APIs.
  - Usage plans, throttling, and security.

- Step Functions:
  - Building serverless workflows.

---

### **5. Monitoring and Optimization**
- **CloudWatch**:
  - Metrics, Logs, and Dashboards.
  - Alarms and Events.

- **Cost Optimization**:
  - Cost Explorer and Budgets.
  - Reserved Instances and Savings Plans.
  - AWS Trusted Advisor (performance and cost recommendations).

- **Auto Scaling**:
  - Horizontal and vertical scaling.
  - Application Auto Scaling for custom resources.

---

### **6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **CloudFormation**:
  - Writing templates for resource provisioning.
  - Nested stacks and custom resources.

- **Terraform** (if applicable to your expertise).
- **AWS CDK** (Cloud Development Kit) for modern IaC.

---

### **7. DevOps Tools**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**:
  - CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline.
  - Integration with Git and Jenkins.

- **Containerization**:
  - ECS, EKS, and Fargate.
  - Docker on AWS.

---

### **8. Real-World Scenarios**
- Architecting highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable solutions.
- Migrating on-premises workloads to AWS.
- Troubleshooting AWS services and optimizing performance.
- Building disaster recovery (DR) solutions.

---

### **9. Interview-Specific Preparation**
- **Scenario-Based Questions**:
  - Building scalable ETL pipelines.
  - Architecting data lake solutions.
  - Cost optimization strategies for data-heavy workloads.

- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Use AWS free tier or sandbox environments to deploy common architectures (e.g., VPC with subnets, Lambda workflows, S3 to Redshift ETL pipelines).
