Alright 🚀 Let’s dive into **Day 1 – Foundations & Big Picture**.

We’ll go step by step: **concepts → diagrams → energy context → practice**.

# 🔑 **1. OLTP vs OLAP**

| Feature   | **OLTP** (Online Transaction Processing)       | **OLAP** (Online Analytical Processing)         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose   | Day-to-day operations (insert, update, delete) | Analytics & decision support (query, aggregate) |
| Data      | Current, detailed, real-time                   | Historical, aggregated, summarized              |
| Example   | Banking system, e-commerce orders              | Sales trends, energy demand forecasting         |
| DB Design | Normalized (3NF), avoids redundancy            | Denormalized (star/snowflake schema)            |
| Workload  | High volume of small transactions              | Fewer but complex queries                       |

👉 **Energy sector example:**

* OLTP: Sensor data from electricity meters every 5 sec.
* OLAP: Daily/weekly grid stability analysis, load forecasting.

---

# 🔑 **2. Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs Data Lakehouse**

### **Data Warehouse**

* Centralized system for **structured, cleaned data**.
* Schema defined *before* load (schema-on-write).
* Best for BI tools, dashboards, KPIs.
* Examples: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift.

### **Data Lake**

* Stores **raw, unstructured & structured data** (cheap storage).
* Schema applied *after* load (schema-on-read).
* Good for ML, data science, exploration.
* Examples: AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, HDFS.

### **Data Lakehouse**

* Hybrid: **Data Lake + Warehouse**.
* Supports ACID transactions + schema evolution.
* Unifies **BI + AI/ML** on one platform.
* Examples: Delta Lake (Databricks), Apache Iceberg, Hudi.

👉 **Energy context:**

* **Warehouse**: KPIs → daily energy import/export between countries.
* **Lake**: Store raw sensor logs from transmission lines.
* **Lakehouse**: Run **real-time + historical analytics** (e.g., predict grid overloads).

# 🔑 **3. Data Flow – Big Picture**

Here’s a **typical end-to-end flow**:

```
   Data Sources
(SCADA, IoT sensors, Market Data, ERP)
       │
       ▼
   Ingestion Layer
(Kafka, APIs, Batch ETL)
       │
       ▼
   Staging Area
   (Raw S3 bucket, Landing Zone)
       │
       ▼
   Data Lake / Lakehouse
(Delta Lake / Iceberg)
       │
       ├── Cleaned / Curated Zone
       ├── Aggregated / Gold Zone
       │
       ▼
   Data Warehouse (optional)
   (Snowflake / Redshift / BigQuery)
       │
       ▼
   BI & Analytics
(Dashboards, Forecasting, ML Models)
```

👉 **Important zones in a Lakehouse:**

* **Raw Zone** – raw sensor or CSV data, immutable.
* **Silver (Curated)** – cleaned, validated, enriched.
* **Gold (Business-ready)** – aggregated for reporting.

# 🔑 **4. ENTSO-E & European Grid Basics**

Since this job is in a **Regional Coordination Centre (RCC)**, context matters.

* **ENTSO-E** = European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity.
* Covers **43 TSOs from 36 European countries**.
* Coordinates **cross-border electricity flows**.
* Ensures **grid stability, reliability, and market integration**.

👉 **Why important for your role?**

* RCC must process **huge volumes of time-series grid data** (voltages, loads, capacity forecasts).
* Architecture must ensure **real-time + historical analysis** with **high reliability**.

---

# 📝 **Practice Exercise**

👉 Design a **simple end-to-end architecture** for RCC grid data:

### Use Case:

“Grid sensors from 12 countries send data every 5 seconds. We want to:

1. Store raw data.
2. Clean and enrich it.
3. Provide dashboards for operators.
4. Enable data scientists to build forecasting models.”

### ✅ **Solution – High-level Architecture Diagram**

```
       Grid Sensors (TSOs)  ──►  Kafka (Streaming Ingestion)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                          Staging / Raw Data (S3 / Delta Bronze)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                        PySpark / dbt Transformations (Airflow Orchestration)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                       Curated Data (Delta Silver)  ──►  ML Models (Forecasting)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                        Aggregated / Gold (Delta + Data Warehouse)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                    BI Dashboards (Tableau/PowerBI) & ENTSO-E Reporting
```

👉 **Key points you’d explain in interview:**

* Why Kafka? → Handles real-time ingestion from sensors.
* Why Delta Lakehouse? → ACID + schema evolution + mix of batch & real-time.
* Why Airflow/dbt? → Orchestration + modular transformations.
* Why BI + ML both? → BI for operators, ML for load forecasting.

✅ **Your Task:**
Draw this architecture (even roughly on paper or a whiteboard). Practice **explaining it in 2–3 minutes** as if you’re in an interview.
