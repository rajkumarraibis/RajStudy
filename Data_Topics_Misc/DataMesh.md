# Data Mesh

Data mesh is a sociotechnical approach to build a decentralized data architecture by leveraging a domain-oriented, self-serve design (in a software development perspective). 

The main proposition is scaling analytical data by domain-oriented decentralization. With data mesh, the responsibility for analytical data is shifted from the central data team to the domain teams, supported by a data platform team that provides a domain-agnostic data platform.

## Principles

Data mesh is based on four core principles:

1. **Domain Ownership**  
2. **Data as a Product**  
3. **Self-Serve Data Platform**  
4. **Federated Computational Governance**

In addition to these principles, the data products created by each domain team should be:
- Discoverable
- Addressable
- Trustworthy
- Possess self-describing semantics and syntax
- Interoperable
- Secure
- Governed by global standards and access controls

In other words, the data should be treated as a product that is ready to use and reliable.
