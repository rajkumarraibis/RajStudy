| Architecture                           | Core Idea                                                 | Strengths                                                        | Limitations                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Medallion (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** | Layered refinement: raw → cleaned → curated               | Simple, modular, great lineage, ideal for Delta Lake & streaming | Can add latency (multi-hop writes), data duplication, complex orchestration for large pipelines |
| **Lambda**                             | Separate real-time + batch layers merged in serving layer | Combines low latency + accuracy                                  | Code duplication between batch & stream; higher maintenance                                     |
| **Kappa**                              | Single streaming layer handles all data (no batch)        | Simplified pipeline, real-time processing only                   | Harder to reprocess historical data; high infra cost                                            |
| **Data Vault**                         | Hub-Link-Satellite model for historized, auditable data   | Strong governance, flexible schema evolution                     | Complex modeling, slower query performance, high learning curve                                 |
| **Modern Data Mesh**                   | Decentralized, domain-owned data products                 | Scalability, ownership, domain expertise                         | Requires strong data governance & platform maturity                                             |
| **Lakehouse (Delta/Unity Catalog)**    | Unified lake + warehouse semantics                        | ACID, governance, BI-ready on open storage                       | Still maturing for complex real-time & governance needs                                         |
