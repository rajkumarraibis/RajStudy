# OLTP, OLAP, Data Warehouse, Data Lake, Data Lakehouse

## 🔎 TL;DR Summary  
- **OLTP** = fast, frequent transactions (banking, e-commerce).  
- **OLAP** = complex queries & analytics (dashboards, forecasting).  
- **Data Warehouse** = structured, schema-on-write, optimized for BI.  
- **Data Lake** = raw, schema-on-read, optimized for ML & exploration.  
- **Data Lakehouse** = hybrid (Delta Lake, Iceberg, Hudi), supports ACID + both BI & ML.  
- **Architecture flow** = Sources → Staging → Lake/Lakehouse → Warehouse → BI/ML.  
- **Energy context (ENTSO-E)** = needs real-time + historical analysis of cross-border electricity grid data.

## 1. OLTP vs OLAP  

| Feature   | **OLTP** (Online Transaction Processing) | **OLAP** (Online Analytical Processing) |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Purpose   | Day-to-day operations (insert, update, delete) | Analytics & decision support (query, aggregate) |
| Data      | Current, detailed, real-time | Historical, aggregated, summarized |
| Example   | Banking system, e-commerce orders | Sales trends, energy demand forecasting |
| DB Design | Normalized (3NF), avoids redundancy | Denormalized (star/snowflake schema) |
| Workload  | High volume of small transactions | Fewer but complex queries |

👉 **Energy sector example:**  
- OLTP → Grid sensors pushing readings every 5 seconds.  
- OLAP → Load forecasting & stability reporting across 12 countries.

## 2. Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs Data Lakehouse  

### **Data Warehouse**
- Centralized system for **structured, cleaned data**.  
- Schema defined *before* load (schema-on-write).  
- Best for BI dashboards.  
- Examples: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift.  

### **Data Lake**
- Stores **raw, unstructured & structured data** (cheap storage).  
- Schema applied *after* load (schema-on-read).  
- Best for ML, data science, exploration.  
- Examples: AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, HDFS.  

### **Data Lakehouse**
- Hybrid: **Data Lake + Data Warehouse**.  
- Supports ACID transactions + schema evolution.  
- Unifies BI + AI/ML workloads.  
- Examples: Delta Lake (Databricks), Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi.  

👉 **Energy context:**  
- **Warehouse** → Daily cross-border energy exchange reports.  
- **Lake** → Raw sensor & SCADA logs.  
- **Lakehouse** → Real-time + historical analysis (predict overloads).

## 3. Data Flow – End-to-End Architecture  

```
   Data Sources
(SCADA, IoT sensors, Market Data, ERP)
       │
       ▼
   Ingestion Layer
(Kafka, APIs, Batch ETL)
       │
       ▼
   Staging Area
   (Raw S3 bucket, Landing Zone)
       │
       ▼
   Data Lake / Lakehouse
(Delta Lake / Iceberg)
       │
       ├── Cleaned / Curated Zone
       ├── Aggregated / Gold Zone
       │
       ▼
   Data Warehouse (optional)
   (Snowflake / Redshift / BigQuery)

```

**Zones in Lakehouse**:  
- **Raw (Bronze)** – raw data, immutable.  
- **Curated (Silver)** – cleaned, validated, enriched.  
- **Business-ready (Gold)** – aggregated for reports.

## 4. ENTSO-E & European Grid Basics  

- **ENTSO-E** = European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity.  
- Represents **43 TSOs across 36 countries**.  
- Ensures **cross-border electricity flow** and **grid stability**.  
- RCCs (Regional Coordination Centres) provide **24/7 monitoring & forecasting**.  

👉 **Relevance for Data Architect:**  
- Must handle **time-series sensor data** at high velocity.  
- Architecture must support **real-time ingestion + historical analysis**.  
- Compliance with **EU data governance & GDPR** is critical.

## 5. Entity Model Example (Energy Grid Context)

A simplified **entity model** for a Regional Coordination Centre (RCC) managing cross-border grid data:

### Entities & Attributes

1. **Grid_Sensor**
   - sensor_id (PK)
   - country_id (FK → Country.country_id)
   - location
   - type (voltage, current, frequency)
   - installation_date

2. **Country**
   - country_id (PK)
   - name
   - tso_name (Transmission System Operator)
   - region

3. **Load_Reading**
   - reading_id (PK)
   - sensor_id (FK → Grid_Sensor.sensor_id)
   - timestamp
   - voltage
   - current
   - frequency
   - load_mw

4. **Capacity_Forecast**
   - forecast_id (PK)
   - country_id (FK → Country.country_id)
   - timestamp
   - forecast_mw
   - model_version

5. **Incident_Report**
   - incident_id (PK)
   - country_id (FK → Country.country_id)
   - timestamp
   - description
   - severity_level

---

### Relationships
- **Country** 1 ──── *M* **Grid_Sensor**  
- **Grid_Sensor** 1 ──── *M* **Load_Reading**  
- **Country** 1 ──── *M* **Capacity_Forecast**  
- **Country** 1 ──── *M* **Incident_Report**  

---

### Diagram (textual representation)

```
Country ──< Grid_Sensor ──< Load_Reading
   │
   ├──< Capacity_Forecast
   └──< Incident_Report
```

👉 **How to explain in an interview:**  
- *“Each country operates multiple grid sensors. Sensors generate continuous load readings. At the country level, RCC generates capacity forecasts and records incident reports for outages or anomalies.”*

## 📝 Practice Exercise  

**Use Case:**  
“Grid sensors from 12 countries send data every 5 seconds. We want to:  
1. Store raw data.  
2. Clean and enrich it.  
3. Provide dashboards for operators.  
4. Enable data scientists to build forecasting models.”  

**Solution – High-level Architecture**
