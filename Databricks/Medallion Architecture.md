## 🔍 What is Medallion Architecture?

The **Medallion Architecture** is a **data design pattern** used in the **lakehouse paradigm** (e.g., Databricks), where data flows through **multiple layers (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**, each increasing in **data quality, structure, and business value**.

It helps ensure:
- Scalability
- Data quality enforcement
- Data lineage and traceability
- Efficient downstream analytics and ML

---

## 🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw / Ingested Data

- Stores **raw, unfiltered data** from source systems.
- Data is typically ingested via **streaming or batch pipelines**.
- Format: **JSON, CSV, Parquet**, or raw Delta.
- Little or no transformation; includes all columns and possible duplicates.

**Use Cases:**
- Archival
- Reprocessing
- Source-of-truth

---

## 🥈 Silver Layer – Cleaned / Refined Data

- Contains **cleaned, filtered, and deduplicated data**.
- Data is **conformed and joined** across sources.
- Ensures **schema enforcement**, data integrity.
- Often includes **business-level entities** (e.g., customers, transactions).

**Use Cases:**
- BI dashboards
- Self-service analytics
- Data science exploration

---

## 🥇 Gold Layer – Business-Level Aggregations

- Optimized for **specific business use cases**.
- Aggregated and enriched metrics (e.g., revenue by region, churn rates).
- Heavily used by **executive dashboards**, **ML models**, **operational systems**.

**Use Cases:**
- KPIs and reports
- AI/ML input tables
- Data apps and APIs

---

## 💡 Benefits of the Medallion Architecture

- **Data Quality Gradients**: Cleaner data as you move from Bronze → Gold.
- **Auditability**: Trace data lineage back to raw sources.
- **Incremental Processing**: Efficient updates using Delta Lake features.
- **Modular & Scalable**: Easy to extend or adapt to new data products.
- **Supports both Batch & Streaming**.

---

## 🚀 Best Practices

- Use **Delta Lake** format for all layers (ACID transactions, versioning).
- Implement **schema enforcement** and **evolution**.
- Automate with **workflow orchestration** (e.g., Databricks Jobs, Airflow).
- Apply **data quality rules (expectations)** at Silver layer.
- Use **Unity Catalog or similar** for governance and access control.

## 📌 Final Thought

The Medallion Architecture is not just a best practice — it's a **foundation** for any scalable, governed, and performant lakehouse on platforms like **Databricks**.  
By structuring your pipelines around **Bronze → Silver → Gold**, you can support **real-time, ML, BI, and operational workloads** with confidence.
