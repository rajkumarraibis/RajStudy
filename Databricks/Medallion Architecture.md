## 🔍 What is Medallion Architecture?

The **Medallion Architecture** is a **data design pattern** used in the **lakehouse paradigm** (e.g., Databricks), where data flows through **multiple layers (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**, each increasing in **data quality, structure, and business value**.

It helps ensure:
- Scalability
- Data quality enforcement
- Data lineage and traceability
- Efficient downstream analytics and ML

---

## 🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw / Ingested Data

- Stores **raw, unfiltered data** from source systems.
- Data is typically ingested via **streaming or batch pipelines**.
- Format: **JSON, CSV, Parquet**, or raw Delta.
- Little or no transformation; includes all columns and possible duplicates.

**Use Cases:**
- Archival
- Reprocessing
- Source-of-truth

---

## 🥈 Silver Layer – Cleaned / Refined Data

- Contains **cleaned, filtered, and deduplicated data**.
- Data is **conformed and joined** across sources.
- Ensures **schema enforcement**, data integrity.
- Often includes **business-level entities** (e.g., customers, transactions).

**Use Cases:**
- BI dashboards
- Self-service analytics
- Data science exploration

---

## 🥇 Gold Layer – Business-Level Aggregations

- Optimized for **specific business use cases**.
- Aggregated and enriched metrics (e.g., revenue by region, churn rates).
- Heavily used by **executive dashboards**, **ML models**, **operational systems**.

**Use Cases:**
- KPIs and reports
- AI/ML input tables
- Data apps and APIs

---

## 💡 Benefits of the Medallion Architecture

- **Data Quality Gradients**: Cleaner data as you move from Bronze → Gold.
- **Auditability**: Trace data lineage back to raw sources.
- **Incremental Processing**: Efficient updates using Delta Lake features.
- **Modular & Scalable**: Easy to extend or adapt to new data products.
- **Supports both Batch & Streaming**.

## 💡 DETAILS

### Building Data Pipelines with Medallion Architecture

Databricks provides tools like **Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines** that allow users to instantly build data pipelines with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** tables from just a few lines of code.

With **streaming tables** and **materialized views**, users can create **streaming Lakeflow pipelines** built on **Apache Spark™ Structured Streaming** that are incrementally refreshed and updated.

➡️ *For more details, see Databricks documentation on combining streaming tables and materialized views in a single pipeline.*

### 🥉 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

- This is where we **land all data from external source systems**.
- Table structures mirror the **"as-is" source system** structure.
- Additional **metadata columns** (load date/time, process ID, etc.) are included.
- Focus:  
  - Quick **Change Data Capture (CDC)**
  - Historical archive of source data (cold storage)
  - **Data lineage**, auditability, and reprocessing capability

---

### 🥈 Silver Layer (Cleansed and Conformed Data)

- Data from the Bronze layer is:
  - **Matched**
  - **Merged**
  - **Cleansed** ("just-enough")
  - **Conformed** to an enterprise standard
- Provides an **"Enterprise View"** of key business entities:
  - Master customers
  - Stores
  - De-duplicated transactions
  - Cross-reference tables
- Enables:
  - **Self-service analytics**
  - **Advanced analytics**
  - **Machine learning**
- Consumers:
  - **Departmental Analysts**
  - **Data Engineers**
  - **Data Scientists**
- Methodology:
  - Typically follows **ELT**, not ETL
  - Emphasis on **speed and agility** in ingestion
  - Complex transformations are deferred to the Gold layer
- Data Modeling:
  - Often **3rd Normal Form**
  - **Data Vault** models (write-performant) are common

---

### 🥇 Gold Layer (Curated Business-Level Tables)

- Organized into **project-specific**, **consumption-ready** databases
- Features **de-normalized**, **read-optimized** data models
- Final layer for:
  - **Data transformations**
  - **Data quality rules**
- Use Cases:
  - Customer Analytics
  - Product Quality Analytics
  - Inventory Analytics
  - Customer Segmentation
  - Product Recommendations
  - Marketing & Sales Analytics
- Data Modeling Styles:
  - **Kimball-style star schemas**
  - **Inmon-style data marts**

---

### 🧠 Summary

As data moves from Bronze → Silver → Gold:

- It becomes more **curated, conformed, and analytics-ready**
- Layers serve **different users** with varying needs — from raw ingestion to high-level business intelligence
- Lakehouse architecture enables **cross-domain analytics** that were previously too expensive or technically impossible on traditional RDBMS stacks

**Examples**:
- IoT/Manufacturing data + Sales/Marketing data → Defect analysis
- Genomics + Clinical EMR data + Claims data → Healthcare Data Lake for improved patient care analytics

---



## 🚀 Best Practices

- Use **Delta Lake** format for all layers (ACID transactions, versioning).
- Implement **schema enforcement** and **evolution**.
- Automate with **workflow orchestration** (e.g., Databricks Jobs, Airflow).
- Apply **data quality rules (expectations)** at Silver layer.
- Use **Unity Catalog or similar** for governance and access control.
