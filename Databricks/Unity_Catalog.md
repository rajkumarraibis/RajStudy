### ## 1. What Is Unity Catalog?

* Unity Catalog is a **centralized metadata and governance layer** across your Databricks workspaces for structured/unstructured data, metrics, AI models, notebooks, dashboards and more ([Databricks Documentation][1], [Databricks][2]).
* Enables **data discovery**, **auditing**, **access control**, **automated lineage**, and **data quality monitoring** ([Databricks Documentation][1]).
* Works across open formats like Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Hudi, Parquet, with full interoperability via open APIs ([Databricks][2]).

### ## 2. Object Model & Terminology

* A **metastore** is the top-level metadata container ‚Äî one per region, shared across workspaces ([Databricks Documentation][1]).
* Hierarchy:

  ```
  Metastore ‚Üí Catalog ‚Üí Schema (Database) ‚Üí Table / View / Volume / Model / Function
  ```
* Tables can be **managed** (full lifecycle managed by Unity Catalog) or **external** (data stored externally but governed via UC) ([Databricks Documentation][1]).
* Other securable objects: **storage credentials**, **external locations**, **connections**, and **service credentials** ‚Äî used for enabling secure access to data sources and external assets ([Databricks Documentation][1]).

---

### ## 3. Setup & Requirements

1. **Enable Unity Catalog:**

   * New workspaces created after Nov 2023 are auto-enabled ([Databricks Documentation][3]).
   * Older workspaces need manual enablement: create metastore, attach it, convert groups to account-level groups ([Databricks Documentation][3]).
2. **Permissions:**

   * Admins must be **account‚Äëlevel or metastore admins**; workspace admins can manage UC if auto-enabled ([Databricks Documentation][3]).
3. **Compute prerequisites:**

   * Clusters must run on Databricks Runtime **11.3 LTS+**, use standard or dedicated access modes ([Databricks Documentation][1]).
   * SQL warehouses fully supported by default.
4. **File formats:**

   * Managed tables: `delta`.
   * External tables: `delta`, `csv`, `json`, `avro`, `parquet`, `ORC`, `text` ([Databricks Documentation][1]).

---

### ## 4. Access Control & Governance

* **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with ANSI SQL‚Äìbased grants; supports row- and column-level policies, with auto‚Äëclassification for sensitive data like PII ([Databricks][2]).
* **Audit logging:** Captures user-level operations across languages & workloads; available via system tables in metastore ([Databricks Documentation][1]).
* **Lineage:** Automated, real-time lineage captured at table- and column-level, across SQL/Python/Scala/R and even AI assets. Available via UI or REST APIs for integration ([Databricks][4]).

---

### ## 5. Data Discovery & Business Context

* **Catalog Explorer** UI enables search, tagging, documentation, and previews‚Äîpermission‚Äëscoped for users ([advancinganalytics.co.uk][5]).
* **Business Metrics Registry:** Define and govern metrics in UC so BI/AI teams use consistent business logic ([Databricks][2]).
* **AI‚Äëpowered documentation & natural‚Äëlanguage search:** Helps technical and business users to find and understand data faster ([Databricks][2]).

---

### ## 6. Data Sharing & Federation

* **Delta Sharing:** Secure, live data sharing across organizations, regions, or clouds‚Äîwithout replication. Works with Unity Catalog governance policies ([Databricks][2]).
* **Lakehouse Federation:** Govern and query data residing in external sources (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, SAP, Hive, Glue, Azure SQL, etc.) without migration ([Databricks][2]).

---

### ## 7. Comparing with Traditional Catalogs

* Unity Catalog acts as a **‚Äúsuper-metastore‚Äù** tightly integrated with Databricks runtime‚Äîoffering governance, lineage, and access control without third-party tools like Collibra or Alation ([Reddit][6]).
* While not as full-featured as enterprise governance suites, it covers core needs within Databricks and now open-sources core UC functionality too.

---

### ## 8. Quick SQL Examples

```sql
-- Grant schema creation rights at catalog level
GRANT CREATE SCHEMA ON catalog_name TO `data-team`;

-- Query which metastore is active
SELECT CURRENT_METASTORE();

-- Create a table in Unity Catalog
CREATE TABLE catalog_name.schema_name.table_name (
  id INT,
  name STRING
);

-- Fine‚Äëgrained access
GRANT SELECT (id) ON catalog_name.schema_name.table_name TO `reports_role`;
```

*(Use backticks and lowercase-only object names due to naming constraints)* ([Databricks Documentation][1])

### üí° Interview Tips

* Emphasize UC‚Äôs integration with the **lakehouse architecture** and **attributes-based access**.
* Be ready to discuss **object model**, **metastore structure**, and **interop with external systems via federation and Delta Sharing**.
* Explain how **lineage, audit, and metrics** support compliance and trustworthy analytics pipelines.
* Mention **new open‚Äësource edition** of Unity Catalog and UCX utilities for migration and automation ([Databricks Documentation][1], [Databricks][2], [advancinganalytics.co.uk][5], [Microsoft Learn][7], [Medium][8], [Databricks Documentation][3]).
