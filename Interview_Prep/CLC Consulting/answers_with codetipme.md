# 🎤 GenAI Data Engineer – Intro Round Quick Sheet

---

## 1️⃣ Tell me about yourself

**Quick Lines:**

* *“I’m Raj, a Lead Data Engineer with 19+ years in data, cloud, and analytics.”*
* *“I specialize in building scalable pipelines (AWS, GCP, Databricks) and recently expanded into Generative AI.”*
* *“My focus now is combining strong DE fundamentals with GenAI for real-world impact.”*

---

## 2️⃣ Why this role / company?

**Quick Lines:**

* *“I want to work where data engineering and GenAI intersect — this role is exactly that.”*
* *“I like the scale (terabyte data, millions of users) — it matches my past work at Humana and Freeletics.”*
* *“The agile, zero-politics culture excites me — I thrive in small, collaborative teams.”*

---

## 3️⃣ Strongest technical skill

**Quick Lines:**

* *“End-to-end pipeline design at TB scale, especially Spark/Databricks optimization.”*
* *“SQL + Python are core strengths; I’m fluent in advanced queries, transformations, and performance tuning.”*

**Code Tip (Broadcast Join in Spark):**

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
df_large.join(broadcast(df_small), "id")
```

---

## 4️⃣ Example of a challenging pipeline (Freeletics Story)

**Quick Lines:**

* *“I redesigned event pipelines in Databricks using Bronze–Silver–Gold Delta.”*
* *“Optimized Spark jobs with repartition, broadcast joins, and caching.”*
* *“Cut costs \~40% and reduced runtime from hours to <30 min.”*

**Code Tip (Repartition vs Coalesce):**

```python
df.repartition(200)   # parallelism
df.coalesce(10)       # compact output
```

---

## 5️⃣ Data Lake Project (Humana Story)

**Quick Lines:**

* *“Built a GCP + Spark healthcare data lake for billions of records.”*
* *“Applied Data Vault modeling for auditability and compliance.”*
* *“Delivered to 200+ analysts, recognized as a global case study.”*

**Code Tip (Partition Pruning in Delta):**

```python
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/data/claims")
df.filter("event_date = '2025-01-01'")
```

---

## 6️⃣ GenAI Experience

**Quick Lines:**

* *“Built a RAG pipeline with LlamaIndex + GPT-4, using embeddings + retrieval.”*
* *“Adapted an open-source project to Postman docs, working with local GPT models.”*
* *“Exploring AI agents to generate SQL and monitor pipelines.”*

**Code Tip (Simple RAG Retrieval):**

```python
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, Document
docs = [Document("text about pipelines")]
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
print(query_engine.query("What is a data pipeline?"))
```

---

## 7️⃣ Computer Vision Awareness

**Quick Lines:**

* *“Not in production yet, but I experimented with OCR (Tesseract) + HuggingFace vision models.”*
* *“See a pipeline: image → OCR → structured text → LLM enrichment.”*

**Code Tip (OCR with Tesseract):**

```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open("flyer.png"))
```

---

## 8️⃣ Ensuring Data Quality

**Quick Lines:**

* *“Validate schema on ingest, add null/duplicate checks in transformations.”*
* *“Use Great Expectations + GitHub Actions for automated checks in CI/CD.”*

**Code Tip (Great Expectations):**

```python
import great_expectations as ge
df_ge = ge.from_pandas(df)
df_ge.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("customer_id")
```

---

## 9️⃣ Staying Current with Tech

**Quick Lines:**

* *“I follow Databricks, HuggingFace, OpenAI — and replicate projects on my setup.”*
* *“Recently retrained a GenAI pipeline on Postman docs to make it domain-specific.”*

---

## 🔟 Why job change now?

**Quick Lines:**

* *“After 4 years at Freeletics, I’ve delivered strong results in data lakes and cost optimization.”*
* *“Now that I have German PR, I’m free to explore new challenges.”*
* *“I want a role that blends DE + GenAI — exactly what this position offers.”*

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Questions *you* can ask them

**Quick Lines:**

1. *“How are you currently using GenAI in production — enrichment or user-facing features?”*
2. *“What’s your biggest challenge with TB-scale pipelines today?”*
3. *“How do you see this role evolving between classic DE and GenAI work?”*

# ✅ Recap: Sound Senior + Hands-On

Keep weaving in terms like:

* SQL → joins, window functions, EXPLAIN.
* Spark → narrow vs wide, shuffle, broadcast join, partition pruning.
* Databricks → Delta Lake, Z-Order, small-file problem.
* GenAI → RAG, embeddings, LLM evaluation.
* CV → OCR + HuggingFace models.
