Find the top 2 users who have spent the most money on confirmed bookings.
For each of these users, show:

user_id
name
total_confirmed_bookings
total_amount_spent


with user_stats as (
	select  u.user_id , u.name ,
	count(1) as total_confirmed_bookings,
	sum(b.amount) as total_amount_spent
	from users u inner join  bookings b on u.user_id = b.user_id
	where b.status='confirmed'
	group by u.user_id , u.name 
	order by total_amount_spent desc
)

select * from
(
	select rank() over(order by total_amount_spent desc) as top_spenders, * from user_stats
)
where top_spenders <= 2
