# Collaboration & Ownership

Throughout my career, I’ve focused on cross-functional collaboration and full ownership — from ideation to production rollout.

## Examples

- **Cross-Team Projects:** Collaborated with backend engineers, data scientists, and product managers to unify user attribution pipelines (app + web) at Freeletics.
- **End-to-End Ownership:** Designed, implemented, and monitored Lambda enrichment systems with full accountability for data accuracy.
- **Mentoring & Knowledge Sharing:** Conducted internal workshops on Spark optimization and AWS cost control.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Introduced structured logging and audit layers that improved traceability for all data workflows.

## Core Message

At ZEAL, I’d bring the same culture of reliability and shared ownership — building systems that empower teams to experiment and trust their data products.
