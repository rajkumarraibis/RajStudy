# ⚡ Cosnova – Senior Data Engineer (Flashcard Prep)

## 🎯 Core Topics

* **ADF SAP CDC Connector**:

  * Scalable (ODP queues + parallel loads).
  * Reliable & idempotent ingestion (delta capture, restart-safe).
  * Future-proof (official SAP + MS support, unlike pyRFC).
  * Handles TB-scale & 300–400 pipelines.
* **DV2.0**: Hubs (keys), Links (relationships), Satellites (history/SCD2).
* **Medallion**: Bronze (raw deltas), Silver (clean + QA + SCD2), Gold (business marts).
* **Quality**: Great Expectations at Silver → schema, nulls, ranges, dedupe.
* **Governance**: Microsoft Purview → catalog, lineage, access control.
* **Observability**: Azure Monitor + Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.
* **IaC**: Terraform to provision ADF, Synapse, ADLS, AKS, Purview.
* **Optimization**: Partition pruning, Z-Ordering, broadcast joins, AQE.
* **Security**: Azure AD + Key Vault + PII masking.

## 🎤 Soundbites

* *“ADF SAP CDC connector solved pyRFC’s limits — scalable, fault-tolerant, SAP-supported.”*
* *“CDC deltas flow raw → GE-validated Silver → DV2 Gold marts.”*
* *“Idempotent MERGE INTO gave us restart safety and consistent state tables.”*
* *“Terraform + CI/CD ensured reproducible environments with governance baked in.”*
* *“Purview lineage helps debug when BI numbers don’t match upstream.”*

## ⚖️ Business Need Alignment

* **Scalability** → Parallel CDC ingestion handles TB-scale.
* **Performance** → Delta queues remove heavy table scans.
* **Deprecation** → pyRFC gone; ODP API is future-proof.
* **Operational pain** → Idempotency + observability reduce restarts.
* **Business value** → Timely BI dashboards, AI-ready clean data.

## ✅ Closing Questions to Ask

* “How far along is Cosnova in automating DV2 constructs (PIT/Bridge tables)?”
* “What’s the biggest pain today: SAP latency, QA, or BI adoption?”
* “Do you foresee expanding Purview governance into quality monitoring as well?”
