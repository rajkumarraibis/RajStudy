# ⚡ Cosnova – Senior Data Engineer (Flashcard Prep)

## 🎯 Core Topics

* **ADF SAP CDC Connector**:

  * Scalable (ODP queues + parallel loads).
  * Reliable & idempotent ingestion (delta capture, restart-safe).
  * Future-proof (official SAP + MS support, unlike pyRFC).
  * Handles TB-scale & 300–400 pipelines.
* **DV2.0**: Hubs (keys), Links (relationships), Satellites (history/SCD2).
* **Medallion**: Bronze (raw deltas), Silver (clean + QA + SCD2), Gold (business marts).
* **Quality**: Great Expectations at Silver → schema, nulls, ranges, dedupe.
* **Governance**: Microsoft Purview → catalog, lineage, access control.
* **Observability**: Azure Monitor + Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.
* **IaC**: Terraform to provision ADF, Synapse, ADLS, AKS, Purview.
* **Optimization**: Partition pruning, Z-Ordering, broadcast joins, AQE.
* **Security**: Azure AD + Key Vault + PII masking.

## 🎤 Soundbites

* *“ADF SAP CDC connector solved pyRFC’s limits — scalable, fault-tolerant, SAP-supported.”*
* *“CDC deltas flow raw → GE-validated Silver → DV2 Gold marts.”*
* *“Idempotent MERGE INTO gave us restart safety and consistent state tables.”*
* *“Terraform + CI/CD ensured reproducible environments with governance baked in.”*
* *“Purview lineage helps debug when BI numbers don’t match upstream.”*

---

## ⚖️ Business Need Alignment

* **Scalability** → Parallel CDC ingestion handles TB-scale.
* **Performance** → Delta queues remove heavy table scans.
* **Deprecation** → pyRFC gone; ODP API is future-proof.
* **Operational pain** → Idempotency + observability reduce restarts.
* **Business value** → Timely BI dashboards, AI-ready clean data.

---

## ✅ Closing Questions to Ask

* “How far along is Cosnova in automating DV2 constructs (PIT/Bridge tables)?”
* “What’s the biggest pain today: SAP latency, QA, or BI adoption?”
* “Do you foresee expanding Purview governance into quality monitoring as well?”

# ⚡ Cosnova – Senior Data Engineer (Flashcard Prep) - OLD

## 🎯 Core Topics
- **DV2.0**: Hubs (keys), Links (relationships), Satellites (history).  
- **Star Schema**: Facts = events (subscriptions/products), Dims = users/customers.  
- **Governance**: Unity Catalog (schemas, ACLs, lineage).  
- **Quality**: Great Expectations → block bad data at Silver.  
- **Azure Stack**: ADLS = S3, ADF = Glue/StepFunctions, Event Hubs = Kinesis, DynamoDB = CosmosDB,Key Vault = Secrets Manager.  
- **Optimization**: Partition pruning, Z-Ordering, broadcast joins, AQE, OPTIMIZE.  
- **CDC**: Auto Loader + MERGE INTO (row-level CDC in Satellites).  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Docker containers + GE tests + Databricks deploys.  
- **IaC**: CloudFormation (AWS) → Terraform (Azure).  
- **Observability**: SLAs, freshness dashboards, Spark UI, cost control (autoscale, spot, OPTIMIZE).  
- **Security**: PII masking (UC), Key Vault secrets, least-privilege.

## 🎤 Soundbites (Drop Naturally)
- *“Unity Catalog gave us schema consistency, ACLs for PII, and lineage from raw to dashboard.”*  
- *“Partition pruning + Z-Ordering kept TB-scale Delta queries performant.”*  
- *“CDC modeled row-level in DV2 Satellites; MERGE INTO + checkpoints gave us idempotency.”*  
- *“We packaged ETL jobs in Docker, tested with GitHub Actions, then deployed to Databricks — same image everywhere.”*  
- *“In AWS I used CloudFormation; in Azure Terraform plays the same role — declarative infra in Git, deployed via CI/CD.”*  
- *“To prevent a swamp: Bronze/Silver/Gold layering, Unity Catalog governance, GE quality gates, and SLAs.”*

## 🧩 Domain Mapping (Freeletics → Cosnova)
- Users → Customers.  
- Subscriptions → Products.  
- Campaigns → Promotions.  
- Fact_SubscriptionEvents → Fact_PromotionEvents.  

---

## ⚖️ Common Prompts
- **“How do you prevent a swamp?”** → Governance, GE, Medallion, SLAs.  
- **“Onboard new source?”** → Auto Loader → GE → DV2 Silver → Gold mart.  
- **“Numbers look off?”** → UC lineage trace + GE checks + CDC merge validation.

## ✅ Closing Questions to Ask
- “How does Cosnova see DV2 evolving — do you already run PIT/Bridge tables?”  
- “What’s your approach to balancing self-service for analysts vs governed data access?”  
- “Where do you see the biggest opportunity for automation in your current stack?”
