# 🎤 Expanded First Round Q\&A (Cosnova – Senior Data Engineer)

---

### 🔹 Q1: *“How would you design a scalable data platform for cosnova that supports analytics and AI use cases?”*

**✅ Final Solution:**
I would design a **Lakehouse architecture on Databricks (Azure)**, structured around the **Medallion architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold). The Silver layer would follow **Data Vault 2.0 modeling** to guarantee historization, flexibility, and auditability. The Gold layer would expose **Star Schema marts** optimized for BI and Finance teams. The entire stack would be governed by **Unity Catalog** (schemas, lineage, ACLs) with **Great Expectations** embedded for quality checks.

**🧠 Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Bronze (Raw landing)**

   * Land raw ERP, CRM, e-commerce, marketing data into **ADLS Gen2** using **Databricks Auto Loader** for incremental loads or **Event Hubs/ADF** for batch + streaming.
   * Store exactly as received, with schema-on-read.

2. **Silver (Integration & Historization using DV2)**

   * Implement **Hubs** for business keys: `Hub_Customer`, `Hub_Product`, `Hub_Promotion`.
   * Implement **Links** for relationships: `Link_CustomerPromotion`, `Link_ProductPromotion`.
   * Implement **Satellites** for historized attributes: `Sat_CustomerAttributes`, `Sat_PromotionEvents`.
   * Use Delta `MERGE INTO` for **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: each update creates a new Satellite row with timestamp and source.

3. **Gold (Consumption marts using Star Schema)**

   * Expose **facts**: e.g. `Fact_PromotionEvents` (event-level grain for purchases, returns, discounts).
   * Expose **dims**: `Dim_Customer`, `Dim_Product`, `Dim_Promotion`.
   * Apply **SCD2** to dims where historical attributes matter (product price, promo details).

4. **Governance + Quality**

   * **Unity Catalog:** All DV2 tables and marts registered → lineage shows flow from raw → curated → dashboard.
   * **Great Expectations:** Validate uniqueness (IDs), referential integrity (Hub ↔ Link), and data freshness.

5. **Consumption**

   * **BI:** Power BI connects to Gold marts.
   * **AI:** Data Scientists access historized Silver tables to train ML models (churn, promo response).

**⚖️ Pros/Cons:**

* ✅ Pros:

  * Flexible schema evolution → adding new data sources = adding new Satellites.
  * Audit/compliance → every change historized in Satellites.
  * Business-friendly → Star marts make KPIs simple for Finance/Marketing.
* ❌ Cons:

  * DV2 is not analyst-friendly (requires PIT/Bridge tables for performance).
  * Slightly higher infra cost due to historization.

**📈 Business Value:**

* Trusted **single source of truth** with history.
* **Analysts** → faster insights with Star.
* **AI teams** → richer historical datasets from DV2.
* **Compliance** → full audit trail for regulatory needs.

**🎯 Freeletics Example:**
“At Freeletics, we ingested subscription events from Stripe and campaign data from Braze. In DV2: `Hub_User`, `Hub_SubscriptionPlan`; `Link_UserPlan`; Satellites stored renewals, cancellations, and price changes with CDC. Then in Gold we built `Fact_SubscriptionEvents` joined with `Dim_User` and `Dim_Plan`. Finance used this for revenue recognition; Product used it for churn analysis; AI teams used Silver for churn prediction models. The layered design gave both trust and usability.”

---

### 🔹 Q2: *“What’s your view on Data Vault 2.0 vs Star Schema? When would you use which?”*

**✅ Final Solution:**
I see DV2 and Star as **complementary, not competing**. DV2 is the **integration backbone** that guarantees historization and auditability, while Star Schema is the **consumption layer** optimized for reporting and self-service.

**🧠 Step-by-step Reasoning:**

* **DV2**

  * Hubs = business keys (stable, e.g. CustomerID, ProductID).
  * Links = relationships (Customer→Promotion).
  * Satellites = historized attributes (price, product category, promo response).
  * Handles schema evolution → adding new sources without disrupting model.
  * Stores all changes (row-level CDC).

* **Star Schema**

  * Facts = measurable events (sales, promo application).
  * Dimensions = descriptive context (product attributes, customer demographics).
  * Denormalized → easy for analysts to query.
  * Optimized for aggregations in BI tools (Power BI, Tableau).

* **Combined Approach**

  * Build DV2 in **Silver layer** → raw, historized, auditable.
  * Transform into Star Schema in **Gold layer** → analyst-ready.

**⚖️ Pros/Cons:**

* DV2 Pros: flexible, historized, resilient. Cons: join-heavy, less user-friendly.
* Star Pros: simple, performant, analyst-friendly. Cons: less granular, harder schema evolution.

**📈 Business Value:**

* DV2 = compliance, flexibility, auditability.
* Star = speed, usability, and broad adoption by business teams.

**🎯 Freeletics Example:**
“In Freeletics, DV2 Satellites stored subscription lifecycle changes (renewal dates, cancellations, plan upgrades). Finance didn’t want to query Satellites directly, so we exposed a Star Schema fact (`Fact_SubscriptionEvents`) joined with dimensions (`Dim_User`, `Dim_SubscriptionPlan`). Analysts queried simple facts/dims in Power BI while AI teams leveraged historized Satellites. This dual model balanced compliance and usability.”

### 🔹 Q3: *“How do you optimize Spark/Databricks pipelines at TB scale?”*

**✅ Final Solution:**
Optimize by reducing shuffles, tuning partitioning, leveraging Delta features (partition pruning, Z-Order), compacting files, and enabling AQE.

**🧠 Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Reduce shuffles**

   * Replace `groupByKey` with `reduceByKey`.
   * Use map-side combiners when possible.

2. **Broadcast joins**

   * For small reference tables (<10MB), avoid shuffle joins by broadcasting.

3. **Partition management**

   * Partition data by natural keys (e.g. `event_date`).
   * Use **partition pruning** → Spark scans only relevant partitions.

4. **Z-Ordering in Delta**

   * Cluster data on frequently filtered columns (e.g. `user_id`).

5. **Small file handling**

   * Auto Loader with file limits.
   * Delta `OPTIMIZE` with `ZORDER`.

6. **AQE (Adaptive Query Execution)**

   * Automatically coalesces small partitions, re-optimizes joins at runtime.

7. **Caching/persisting**

   * Cache datasets reused in multiple steps (ML features, iterative aggregations).

**⚖️ Pros/Cons:**

* ✅ Faster jobs, reduced costs, fresher dashboards.
* ❌ Requires ongoing monitoring → partition skew can reappear with data growth.

**📈 Business Value:**

* Improves SLAs for reporting.
* Reduces cloud compute bills.
* Unlocks new use cases (AI pipelines on fresher data).

**🎯 Freeletics Example:**
“At Freeletics, our subscription event pipeline grew to TB scale. By partitioning on `event_date` and Z-Ordering on `user_id`, we cut a 4-hour batch job to 30 minutes. We also used broadcast joins for user metadata, and OPTIMIZE to merge small JSON files. This saved \~40% compute and allowed Finance dashboards to refresh before 9AM every day.”

### 🔹 Q4: *“How do you ensure data quality and governance in pipelines?”*

**✅ Final Solution:**
I combine **quality checks (Great Expectations)**, **governance (Unity Catalog)**, and **CI/CD validation** for consistency.

**🧠 Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Quality (Great Expectations)**

   * Null checks: `expect_column_values_to_not_be_null(user_id)`.
   * Uniqueness checks: Event IDs unique.
   * Referential integrity: user\_id in Hub must exist in Fact.
   * Row count thresholds: detect schema drift or partial loads.

2. **Governance (Unity Catalog)**

   * Register all DV2 + Star tables in UC.
   * Lineage: trace Gold → Silver → Bronze.
   * Column-level ACLs: mask PII (emails, names).

3. **CI/CD pipelines**

   * GitHub Actions runs GE suites + PySpark unit tests inside Docker before deploying.
   * Failed test = blocked deployment.

4. **Observability**

   * Freshness dashboards (last loaded timestamp).
   * SLA monitoring for delayed jobs.

**⚖️ Pros/Cons:**

* ✅ Builds trust, prevents “garbage in, garbage out”.
* ❌ Adds pipeline overhead (extra runs/tests).

**📈 Business Value:**

* Analysts & Finance trust the numbers.
* Fewer escalations “data looks wrong”.
* Faster onboarding of new data sources (confidence from checks).

**🎯 Freeletics Example:**
“At Freeletics, Great Expectations caught null user IDs in subscription events before they hit Gold. Unity Catalog lineage traced Finance KPIs back to raw Stripe events. This combination reduced escalations by 70% and gave executives confidence in dashboards.”

### 🔹 Q5: *“Tell me about a conflict with stakeholders and how you resolved it.”*

**✅ Final Solution:**
I use phased delivery: unblock stakeholders quickly with temporary data, while building long-term governed solutions.

**🧠 Step-by-step Reasoning:**

* **Situation:** Product team needed churn metrics urgently; existing pipelines refreshed only weekly.
* **Task:** Deliver insights quickly without bypassing governance.
* **Action:**

  * Built a temporary dataset from raw Stripe data in 2 days.
  * Parallel: implemented DV2 → Star fact table for churn analysis in 2 weeks.
* **Result:** Stakeholders unblocked immediately while governance was preserved long-term.

**⚖️ Pros/Cons:**

* ✅ Builds trust, avoids delays.
* ❌ Temporary solution = short-term maintenance overhead.

**📈 Business Value:**

* Stakeholders got speed + accuracy.
* Platform team maintained standards.
* Strengthened collaboration between product and data teams.

**🎯 Freeletics Example:**
“In Freeletics, I delivered a quick churn dataset directly from Bronze Stripe events for PMs. Meanwhile, we built a DV2 Satellite + Gold fact for churn analysis. Product moved fast, Finance got governed, historized metrics.”

### 🔹 Q6: *“How do you handle infra deployment and CI/CD for data pipelines?”*

**✅ Final Solution:**
I use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** for infra, **Docker** for reproducible builds, and **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.

**🧠 Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **IaC**

   * AWS: CloudFormation.
   * Azure: Terraform → ADLS, Event Hubs, Databricks workspace, Key Vault.
   * Infra in Git → PR-reviewed → applied via CI.

2. **Containers (Docker)**

   * Package PySpark jobs with dependencies.
   * Run tests in container for consistent runtime.
   * Optional: build custom Docker image for Databricks clusters if special libs needed.

3. **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**

   * Steps: lint → unit tests → Great Expectations data tests → build Python wheel → deploy to Databricks Jobs API.
   * Failures stop deployment.

4. **Secrets management**

   * Store secrets in Azure Key Vault, inject at runtime with service principals.

**⚖️ Pros/Cons:**

* ✅ Reproducible, consistent, testable deployments.
* ❌ Needs DevOps culture; initial setup cost.

**📈 Business Value:**

* Faster deployments, fewer “works on my laptop” issues.
* Compliance → full infra + pipeline definitions in Git.
* Quick rollback on failures.

**🎯 Freeletics Example:**
“At Freeletics, infra was defined in CloudFormation (S3, EMR, IAM). Pipelines were containerized in Docker, tested with GE inside CI. GitHub Actions deployed wheels to Databricks Jobs. The same flow can be mirrored in Azure with Terraform, ACR, and Key Vault.”
