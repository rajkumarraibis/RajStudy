Got it ✅ Raj — I’ll prepare you a **separate `spark_optimization.md`** file that’s concise, senior-level, and includes all the important Databricks/Spark 3 optimization concepts.

Here’s the draft in **Markdown** (easy to reuse as notes):

# ⚡ Spark Optimization Guide (Databricks Focus)

## 🔹 General Principle
Always **profile with Spark UI**, optimize to **minimize shuffles, scans, and skew**, and use **Databricks/Delta features** like OPTIMIZE, Z-Order, and caching smartly.

---

## 🚀 Spark 3.0+ Features
- **Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)** (enabled by default in Databricks):
  - Dynamically adjusts shuffle partitions based on runtime stats.
  - Automatically switches join strategies (e.g., sort-merge → broadcast if small enough).
  - Skew join handling (splits skewed partitions into smaller chunks).
  
👉 **Interview Line:**  
*“On Databricks with Spark 3, I always rely on AQE — it auto-tunes shuffle partitions, fixes skew, and optimizes joins at runtime.”*

---

## 🔹 Partition Pruning
- Reads only the partitions relevant to a query instead of scanning the full dataset.
- Best for **low-cardinality partition keys** (e.g., `event_date`, `region`).

```sql
-- Partition table by event_date
CREATE TABLE bronze.events
USING delta
PARTITIONED BY (event_date)
AS SELECT * FROM raw_events;

-- Query only scans 2025-08-01 folder
SELECT * FROM bronze.events WHERE event_date='2025-08-01';
````

👉 **Value:** Faster queries, lower costs.

---

## 🔹 Z-Ordering (Delta Lake)

* **Multi-dimensional clustering** → sorts files inside partitions by high-cardinality keys (e.g., `user_id`, `product_id`).
* Works with OPTIMIZE command.

```sql
OPTIMIZE silver.subscriptions
ZORDER BY (user_id);
```

👉 **Value:** Data skipping within partitions.
👉 **Partition + Z-Order combo:** Macro + micro pruning.

---

## 🔹 Broadcast Joins

* Send small table to all executors to avoid shuffle.
* Best for dim tables < \~500 MB.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
big.join(broadcast(dim_small), "key")
```

👉 **Value:** Eliminates expensive shuffle in fact-dim joins.

---

## 🔹 Repartition vs Coalesce

* `repartition(n)` → full shuffle, increases partitions (good for scaling up parallelism).
* `coalesce(n)` → reduces partitions without shuffle (good for compacting output files).

👉 **Rule of Thumb:**

* Use `repartition` before heavy shuffles/joins.
* Use `coalesce` before writing results to Delta.

---

## 🔹 Narrow vs Wide Transformations

* **Narrow** → no shuffle (map, filter, mapPartitions).
* **Wide** → shuffle needed (groupByKey, join, distinct).
* Optimize by reducing wide ops and combining filters/maps.

👉 **Value:** Less network + disk I/O.

---

## 🔹 Caching / Persisting

* Cache intermediate DataFrames reused multiple times.
* Don’t forget to `unpersist()`.

```python
df_cached = df_clean.cache()
result1 = calc1(df_cached)
result2 = calc2(df_cached)
df_cached.unpersist()
```

👉 **Value:** Avoid recomputation across jobs.

---

## 🔹 Data Skew Handling

* **Symptoms:** Few partitions are much larger → long-running tasks.
* **Fixes:**

  * Salt keys (add random number to skewed join keys).
  * Increase shuffle partitions (`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`).
  * AQE skew join handling (auto in Spark 3+).

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import rand
df = big.withColumn("salt", (rand()*10).cast("int"))
```

---

## 🔹 Delta Lake Optimizations

1. **Small File Problem** → compact with OPTIMIZE.
2. **Time Travel** → debug / audit historical data.
3. **MERGE INTO** → efficient CDC upserts.
4. **Data Skipping** → via partitioning + Z-Order.

```sql
MERGE INTO silver.users t
USING staging.users s
ON t.user_id = s.user_id
WHEN MATCHED AND s._ts > t._ts THEN UPDATE SET *
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *;
```

---

## 🔹 Cost & Performance Tuning

* **Cluster Sizing:** Right-size based on workload, prefer autoscaling.
* **Spot Instances:** For non-critical jobs.
* **File Size Tuning:** Aim for 128MB–1GB Delta files.
* **OPTIMIZE Frequency:** Daily/weekly depending on ingest volume.

---

## 🎤 Interview Soundbites (Ready-to-Drop)

* *“Partition pruning + Z-Ordering are my go-to for keeping TB-scale Delta queries performant.”*
* *“I broadcast small lookups to cut shuffle, and rely on AQE to auto-adjust joins and handle skew.”*
* *“To control costs, I compact small files with OPTIMIZE and tune partitions to match cluster parallelism.”*
* *“Unity Catalog + Great Expectations ensure governance and data quality on top of these performance gains.”*

👉 Raj, this new file is your **Spark Optimization quick reference**.  
Would you like me to also generate a **visual cheatsheet diagram** (Spark → AQE → Partition/Z-Order → Delta optimizations) so you can glance at it before the interview?
