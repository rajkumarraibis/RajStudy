Here’s a concise set of notes summarizing the key concepts from the **"Machine Learning Foundations: Statistics"** course on LinkedIn Learning:

---

### **1. Introduction to Statistics for Machine Learning**
- **Statistics in ML**: Helps identify patterns and make decisions from data.
- **Key Applications**: Data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

---

### **2. Types of Data**
- **Categorical**:
  - Nominal: No order (e.g., colors, gender).
  - Ordinal: Ordered categories (e.g., ratings like good, better, best).
- **Numerical**:
  - Discrete: Countable numbers (e.g., number of pets).
  - Continuous: Infinite possible values within a range (e.g., height, weight).

---

### **3. Measures of Central Tendency**
- **Mean**: Average of data.
- **Median**: Middle value when sorted.
- **Mode**: Most frequent value.

---

### **4. Measures of Dispersion**
- **Range**: Difference between max and min.
- **Variance**: Average squared deviation from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance; shows data spread.

---

### **5. Probability Basics**
- **Probability**: Likelihood of an event (0 to 1 scale).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Independent events: Outcomes don’t affect each other.
  - Conditional probability: Probability of one event given another.

---

### **6. Probability Distributions**
- **Normal Distribution**:
  - Bell-shaped curve.
  - Defined by mean (center) and standard deviation (spread).
- **Other Distributions**:
  - Binomial: Discrete outcomes (e.g., coin toss).
  - Poisson: Rare events over time/space (e.g., calls per hour).

---

### **8. Correlation and Causation**
- **Correlation**: Relationship strength between two variables.
  - Positive: Variables move in the same direction.
  - Negative: Variables move in opposite directions.
- **Causation**: Direct cause-effect relationship.
  - Correlation ≠ Causation.

---

### **9. Linear Regression Basics**
- **Regression**: Predicting numerical outcomes.
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Relationship between one independent variable (x) and one dependent variable (y).
  - Equation: \( y = mx + c + \epsilon \) (where \( \epsilon \) is error).

---

### **10. Common Pitfalls in Statistics**
- **Overfitting**: Model too complex; fits training data but not generalizable.
- **Bias**: Systematic error in predictions.
- **Variance**: High sensitivity to training data noise.
