Here’s a concise set of notes summarizing the key concepts from the **"Machine Learning Foundations: Statistics"** course on LinkedIn Learning:

---

### **1. Introduction to Statistics for Machine Learning**
- **Statistics in ML**: Helps identify patterns and make decisions from data.
- **Key Applications**: Data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

---

### **2. Types of Data**
- **Categorical**:
  - Nominal: No order (e.g., colors, gender).
  - Ordinal: Ordered categories (e.g., ratings like good, better, best).
- **Numerical**:
  - Discrete: Countable numbers (e.g., number of pets).
  - Continuous: Infinite possible values within a range (e.g., height, weight).

---

### **3. Measures of Central Tendency**
- **Mean**: Average of data.
- **Median**: Middle value when sorted.
- **Mode**: Most frequent value.

---

### **4. Measures of Dispersion**
- **Range**: Difference between max and min.
- **Variance**: Average squared deviation from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance; shows data spread.

---

### **5. Probability Basics**
- **Probability**: Likelihood of an event (0 to 1 scale).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Independent events: Outcomes don’t affect each other.
  - Conditional probability: Probability of one event given another.

---

### **6. Probability Distributions**
- **Normal Distribution**:
  - Bell-shaped curve.
  - Defined by mean (center) and standard deviation (spread).
- **Other Distributions**:
  - Binomial: Discrete outcomes (e.g., coin toss).
  - Poisson: Rare events over time/space (e.g., calls per hour).

---

### **8. Correlation and Causation**
- **Correlation**: Relationship strength between two variables.
  - Positive: Variables move in the same direction.
  - Negative: Variables move in opposite directions.
- **Causation**: Direct cause-effect relationship.
  - Correlation ≠ Causation.

---

### **9. Linear Regression Basics**
- **Regression**: Predicting numerical outcomes.
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Relationship between one independent variable (x) and one dependent variable (y).
  - Equation: \( y = mx + c + \epsilon \) (where \( \epsilon \) is error).

---

### **10. Common Pitfalls in Statistics**
- **Overfitting**: Model too complex; fits training data but not generalizable.
- **Bias**: Systematic error in predictions.
- **Variance**: High sensitivity to training data noise.

---

Here are some practical code examples and insights into how machine learning (ML) uses statistics like **mean**, **mode**, and **median**, along with other statistical concepts.

---

### **Code Examples**
#### 1. **Calculating Mean, Median, and Mode Using NumPy and SciPy**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Example dataset
data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7]

# Mean
mean_value = np.mean(data)
print("Mean:", mean_value)

# Median
median_value = np.median(data)
print("Median:", median_value)

# Mode
mode_value = stats.mode(data)
print("Mode:", mode_value.mode[0], "Frequency:", mode_value.count[0])
```

---

#### 2. **Calculating Variance and Standard Deviation**
```python
# Variance
variance = np.var(data)
print("Variance:", variance)

# Standard Deviation
std_dev = np.std(data)
print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)
```

---

#### 3. **Correlation Coefficient**
```python
# Two variables
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

correlation = np.corrcoef(x, y)[0, 1]
print("Correlation Coefficient:", correlation)
```

---

### **Practical Topics: How ML Uses These Statistics**

#### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Mean, Median, and Mode**:
  - Handle missing values:
    ```python
    data_with_nan = [1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5]
    filled_data = np.nan_to_num(data_with_nan, nan=np.mean(data_with_nan))
    print("Filled Data:", filled_data)
    ```
  - Replace missing values with mean/median/mode.

- **Standardization (Z-Score Normalization)**:
  - Convert data to a standard scale (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).
    ```python
    standardized_data = (data - np.mean(data)) / np.std(data)
    print("Standardized Data:", standardized_data)
    ```

---

#### 2. **Feature Selection**
- **Variance Thresholding**:
  - Remove features with low variance, as they contribute less to the model.
    ```python
    from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold

    data_features = [[0, 2, 0.2], [1, 3, 0.3], [0, 2, 0.1]]
    selector = VarianceThreshold(threshold=0.2)
    selected_features = selector.fit_transform(data_features)
    print("Selected Features:", selected_features)
    ```

---

#### 3. **Model Evaluation**
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Test if a feature is statistically significant for predicting the target variable.
- **Correlation**:
  - Identify relationships between features and target variables.

---

#### 4. **Outlier Detection**
- **Using Median and Standard Deviation**:
  - Detect outliers by identifying values far from the mean or median.
    ```python
    z_scores = (data - np.mean(data)) / np.std(data)
    outliers = np.where(abs(z_scores) > 2)  # Threshold = 2
    print("Outliers at indices:", outliers)
    ```

---

#### 5. **Clustering**
- **Centroids in k-Means**:
  - Mean is used to compute cluster centroids repeatedly during training.

---

#### 6. **Recommendation Systems**
- **Correlation Coefficients**:
  - Use Pearson or Spearman correlation to find similarities between users or items.

---

#### 7. **Regression Analysis**
- **Linear Regression**:
  - Minimizes the sum of squared errors, a direct application of variance and mean.

---

### **Practical ML Example: Normalization Before Training**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example dataset
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6], [4, 8], [5, 10]])
y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Standardizing the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Splitting the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Model Coefficients:", model.coef_)
print("Model Intercept:", model.intercept_)
```

These examples and practical applications demonstrate how statistical concepts underpin essential steps in machine learning pipelines.
