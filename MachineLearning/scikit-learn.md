# Effective Machine Learning with scikit-learn

## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning

- **Definition**: Building programs with tunable parameters that improve through experience.
- **Categories**:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Models trained on labeled data.
    - *Examples*: Classification, Regression
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Models trained on unlabeled data.
    - *Examples*: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

## 2. scikit-learn Basics

- **Data Representation**: Data is stored in a two-dimensional array `[n_samples, n_features]`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Consistent interface for ML models
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Active community support

## 3. Machine Learning Workflow with scikit-learn

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load data using pandas.
   - Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose appropriate algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors).
   - Initialize the model with default or specified hyperparameters.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Fit the model to the training data using `.fit()`.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Make predictions on test data using `.predict()`.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall for classification.
   - Use metrics like R-squared, RMSE for regression.
   - Perform cross-validation to assess model performance.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use Grid Search or Randomized Search to find optimal parameters.

7. **Model Validation**:
   - Evaluate the model on validation data to check for overfitting or underfitting.

8. **Pipeline Creation**:
   - Use `Pipeline` to streamline preprocessing and modeling steps.

## 4. Model Evaluation Metrics

- **Classification Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Table showing true vs. predicted classifications.
  - **Precision**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives).
  - **Recall**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives).
  - **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  - **ROC Curve**: Graph showing true positive rate vs. false positive rate.
  - **AUC**: Area under the ROC curve.

- **Regression Metrics**:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute errors.
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared errors.
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE.
  - **R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained by the model.

## 5. scikit-learn vs. TensorFlow

### **Differences**:
| Feature         | scikit-learn | TensorFlow |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **Type** | Traditional ML library | Deep Learning framework |
| **Best for** | Classical ML algorithms | Neural Networks & Deep Learning |
| **Ease of Use** | Simple API for ML tasks | Complex, requires more code |
| **Preprocessing** | Provides built-in preprocessing utilities | Requires separate preprocessing steps |
| **Performance** | Works well with structured and small-medium datasets | Optimized for large, unstructured data |

### **When to Use scikit-learn**:
- Best for small to medium **structured datasets**.
- Ideal for traditional ML models (Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.).
- When you need **quick prototyping** and simple implementation.
- Suitable for **tabular, numerical, and categorical data**.

### **When Not to Use scikit-learn**:
- Not suitable for **deep learning** or complex neural networks.
- Struggles with **very large datasets** (big data) due to memory constraints.
- Not optimized for **unstructured data** like images, audio, and text (use TensorFlow or PyTorch instead).

## 6. Best Use Cases for scikit-learn

- **Small to medium-sized datasets**
- **Structured data (tabular, numerical, categorical)**
- **Classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction**
- **Feature engineering and preprocessing pipelines**
- **Quick ML model development and evaluation**
